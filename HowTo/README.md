# How-To: Ionic with Google Maps

This How-To Guide was an assignment for my mobile and cloud development class. The guide documents how to create an Android app using Ionic Framework 1.0 to utilize a Google Map with custom makers and information windows to display data about Seattle building permits. The Ionic Framework, Cordova, and AngularJS were utilized along with Google Maps APIs for the mapping portion and SODA Consumer API for the Seattle building permit data.
