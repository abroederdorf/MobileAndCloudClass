# Runners Aid App

This is the start to my android app, Runners Aid - the virtual aid station for runners. This implements the place portion of the API I created to view both a list and map of places, edit the details, and add a new place. The final project will implement user login and features releated to user specific data such as favorites. 


This app is created using the Ionic Framework 1.0 which is based on HTML5, CSS, and AngularJS. I'm using Cordova plugins to access native phone components such as the location, as well as Google Map APIs for viewing the data on a map. The API used as the backend for this app is my Hw3 assignment, files found [here](https://github.com/abroederdorf/MobileAndCloudClass/tree/master/Hw3).
